# 🚀 Featured Project

## DARPA Triage Challenge - Core Member, Team Chiron
**Development and Deployment of Remote Health Sensing Models**

> *“When we have a significant emergency where there could be danger to the responders, you can save lives by not sending in a human right away. This autonomous triage system allows us to provide rapid help to as many victims as possible without needing extra human power — an essential gap to fill when medics are limited.”*  
> — **Dr. Lenny Weiss**, Professor of Emergency Medicine, UPitt; Medical Director of City of Pittsburgh Police-SWAT

## 🔬 Key Contributions

### 🏥 Ocular Alertness Detection
- Developed an **ARKit-based system** to assess **ocular alertness** via **blink rate tracking**.
![A rough version of the software that formed the basis of the ocular alertness characterisation pipeline](images/projects/ARKit.png){width=60% fig-align="right"}

### ❤️ Heart Rate (HR) Detection
- Led testing across **classical spectral-reflectance models** and **transformer-based architectures**.
- **Final model deployed**: a **3D CNN-based system**, benchmarked extensively on **custom IRB-approved datasets**.

### 🩸 Hemorrhage Detection
- Conducted extensive benchmarking of **segmentation models** and **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**.
- **Final deployment**: A **segmentation model** detecting severe hemorrhage presence **in real-time robotic data streams**.

> This research opened a new problem space—**achieving grounding in small models for data-scarce tasks**.  
> As we tackle the much harder challenge of performing hemorrhage detection in further degraded sensing environments for Year #2 Challenge (daytime operations in thick smoke, nightime operations with no visible illumination, etc.) we are continuing to investigate - (i) how do we achieve strong visual grounding in unstructured environments despite the scarcity of relevant data? and (ii) how do we use multimodal data streams - like multispectral imaging - to characterize hemorrhage presence even in absence of RGB illumination?

## 🎭 Uncertainty-Aware Segmentation
- Developed a framework for **uncertainty-aware segmentation**, in collaboration with a friend and a fellow researcher, [Nishanth TA](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5uDXUvIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
<!-- - **Visualizing model uncertainty** to enhance interpretability and trustworthiness. -->
- Research manuscript in progress.
